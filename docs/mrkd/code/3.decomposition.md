# Decompositions

Moment optimization programs can be used to compute decomposition of different forms.

## Tensor Decompositions

Tensor decomposition problems can be seen as Generalized Moment Problems, by apolarity. 
See e.g. [GM25](https://hal.science/hal-04885482v4).

Below are functions, which compute positive and real decompositions of symmetric tensors.
