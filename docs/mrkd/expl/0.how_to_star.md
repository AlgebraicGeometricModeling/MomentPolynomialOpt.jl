# How to start

First install a SDP solver,  e.g. CSDP:
```
] add CSDP
```
Then set the SDP solver to used in the Moment programs:
```
using MomentPolynomialOpt
using  CSDP
mpo_optimizer(CSDP.Optimizer)
```
See @ref mpo_optimizer

Now we build a moment optimization program
```
using DynamicPolynomials # for multivariate polynomials

X = @polyvar x y

f = x*y+y^3    # objective function
g = 1-x^2-y^2  # sign constraint g>=0

v, M = maximize(f, [], [g], X, 3 )
```
To get the optimal measure as a weighted sum of Diracs
```
w, Xi = get_measure(M)
```
We obtain
```
([0.9999999991407329], [0.30029543782848245; 0.9538462396080524;;])
```
that is the Dirac at the point ``[0.30029543782848245, 0.9538462396080524]``
with weight $\approx 1$.

We can add an equality constraint: e.g. the diagonal $x-y=0$:
```
v, M = maximize(f, [x-y], [g], X, 3 )
w, Xi = get_measure(M)
```
and we get
```
([0.999999999912873], [0.7071067811222742; 0.7071067811432977;;])
```
