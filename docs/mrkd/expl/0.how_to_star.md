# How to start

First we need to install a SDP solver,  e.g. CSDP:
```
] add CSDP
```
Then we set the SDP solver to be used in the Moment programs:
```
using MomentPolynomialOpt
using  CSDP; mpo_optimizer(CSDP.Optimizer)
```
See [mpo_optimizer](@ref)

Now we build a moment optimization program
```
using DynamicPolynomials # for multivariate polynomials

X = @polyvar x y

f = x*y+y^3    # objective function
g = 1-x^2-y^2  # sign constraint g>=0

v, M = maximize(f, [], [g], X, 3 )
```
We specify the variables array `X`, the order of the relaxation $\ell=3$, which means that the moments of order $\le 2\ell$ are used.
See [optimize](@ref), [maximize](@ref), [minimize](@ref).


To get the optimal measure as a weighted sum of Diracs:
```
w, Xi = get_measure(M)
```
We obtain
```
([0.9999999991407329], [0.30029543782848245; 0.9538462396080524;;])
```
that is, the Dirac measure at the point ``[0.30029543782848245, 0.9538462396080524]``
with weight $\approx 1$.
See [get_measure](@ref).

The corresponding optimal moment sequence is given as a series:
```
get_series(M)

1.0 + 0.953846dy + 0.300295dx + 0.909822dy^2 + 0.286435dx*dy + ... + 0.0007333dx^6
```
See [get_series](@ref).

Let us add now an equality constraint, e.g. the diagonal $x-y=0$ and another sign  constraint $x\ge 0$:
```
v, M = maximize(f, [x-y], [g, x], X, 3 )
Xi = get_optimizers(M)
```
We get the single point on the diagonal intersected with the half unit disk such that `f` is maximal: 
```
2×1 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.7071067810309548
 0.7071067812499313
```
