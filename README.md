# MomentTools.jl

This a Julia package for solving polynomial optimization problems, via moment matrix relaxations.
It provides tools to optimize vectors of moment sequences that sastisfy positivity constraints or mass constraints, to extract minimizers from moment sequences, compute the annihilator of a sequence, polar ideals, ...
It uses a connection with SDP solvers via the [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) interface.



## Installation

The package can be installed in julia as follows:

```julia
] add https://github.com/AlgebraicGeometricModeling/MomentTools.jl
```
