# MomentPolynomialOpt.jl

This a Julia package for solving moment and polynomial optimization problems.
It provides tools to optimize polynomial functions on semi-algebraic sets defined by polynomial inequalities and equalities, vectors of moment sequences that sastisfy positivity constraints or mass constraints, to extract minimizers from moment sequences, compute the annihilator of a sequence, polar ideals, ...
It uses a connection with SDP solvers via the [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) interface.



## Installation

The package can be installed in julia as follows:

```julia
] add https://github.com/AlgebraicGeometricModeling/MomentPolynomialOpt.jl
```
